# Stars-Rain-Streamer.Bot
## Mini game where a random number of stars falls and while running you can guess the number in chat.

## This is still in testing so there might be LOTS of BUGS for now, I will try to fix any problems asap!
## Many thanks to [streamerbot.com ](https://streamer.bot/) which I used.

🔘Commands: ◻️ !rain ( Guess the number after the command. *I would add a cooldown to the command to not be spammed* ).

🔘For the command that triggers the rain, you have to add a trigger yourself, a timer would work the best, but you can use it when someone subscribes for example, your choice.
